# Hi 👋
My name is Sarah and I'm a management consultant turned data analyst. Highlights of my career include:
- Improving primary health for a rural province of 35 million people in Pakistan - improved medicine availability and doctor availability by 10% and 30% respectively
- Launched the COVID-19 Rapid Response Helpline for the same province when COVID-19 hit - did everything from contracting the provider, designing surveys and scripts, developing dashboard for monitoring
- Worked closely with a former Nigerian Education Minister to launch her non-profit organisation that would advocate for foundational literacy in Africa
- Launched Karachi's first charity running event called Special Olympics Pakistan Annual Half-marathon. The event is now in its 11th year
- Worked on various railway reforms in the UK and Saudi Arabia

I'm now transitioning to data analytics as I love telling stories with data. Recently completed the LSE Data Analytics Career Accelerator ranking in the top 5% of the cohort. 

I love women's sports and play football regularly. I pen my analysis and thoughts on women's sports here: https://substack.com/@sarahaminali?
